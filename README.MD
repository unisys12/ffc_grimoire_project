FFC Grimoire Project
====================

## Purpose
Gather the Grimoire for the game Destiny, in a verstial format and place it in a centralized location. By the end of the project _(does it ever really end?)_ we hope to create a small application that can be run from the cmd line, download either the Grimoire or Items and store that in a CSV format in a Google Drive folder.

## Proposed Methods
At this early stage, there is no build process in place and really don't know if we need one for such a small project. Maybe bringing Babeljs onboard would not be a bad idea, but... I want to keep things as simple as possible.

## Current Status
Project is just getting started, so... hop on board!

## Usage
At the moment, for useage examples just check `index.js` in the projects src folder.

## To-Do-List
<dl>
  <dt>Create Core Logic</dt>
  <dd>The core logic will reside within `index.js`. It will interprate cmds given at the cmd line and based in that, create a Grimoire csv file or a Items csv file.</dd>
  <dt>Work on Drive Intergration</dt>
  <dd>I have the basics in place, but failed to work-out authenication.</dd>
